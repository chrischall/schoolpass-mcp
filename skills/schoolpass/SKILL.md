name: schoolpass
description: This skill should be used when the user asks about their child's school arrival/dismissal through a SchoolPass parent account. Triggers on phrases like "check SchoolPass", "when is my kid dismissed", "what's my dismissal default", "list my students in SchoolPass", "who are my pickup drivers", "any pickup changes today", "school dismissal locations", or any request to read a SchoolPass parent account.

# schoolpass-mcp

MCP server for the SchoolPass REST API used by the SchoolPass web and mobile apps — a parent's students, arrival/dismissal calendar, pending pickup changes, authorized drivers, dismissal locations, and school info, using the user's own parent account.

- **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/schoolpass-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schoolpass-mcp)
- **Source:** [github.com/chrischall/schoolpass-mcp](https://github.com/chrischall/schoolpass-mcp)

Parent-scoped: read tools plus a confirm-gated dismissal-change write.

## Setup

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project or `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "schoolpass": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "schoolpass-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SCHOOLPASS_EMAIL": "you@example.com",
        "SCHOOLPASS_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SCHOOLPASS_SCHOOL_CODE": "1183"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`SCHOOLPASS_SCHOOL_CODE` is the numeric school id (the `AppCode` / `appCode`
value the app uses; e.g. 1183 for Scholars Academy). Set `SCHOOLPASS_API_HOST`
too if your school is on a different regional shard than the default
`busapi-east16-ss.school-pass.net`.

## First call

Start with `schoolpass_healthcheck` — it reports whether the API host is
reachable and, separately, whether the credentials log in, so a network problem
reads differently from a wrong password or school code. Then `schoolpass_whoami`
confirms the parent identity, and `schoolpass_list_students` gives you the
student ids the calendar and pickup-change tools need.

**If a login is rejected, STOP.** SchoolPass fronts its login with reCAPTCHA;
repeated failures can get the account challenged. Tell the user to check the
email/password/school-code — never retry with a guess.

## Tools

| Tool | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `schoolpass_healthcheck` | Reachability + auth, separated. No secrets in the output. Start here when a tool says it is not configured. |
| `schoolpass_whoami` | The parent identity the server signed in as (member id, user type, name). |
| `schoolpass_list_students(view?)` | The parent's linked students — name, grade, home dismissal location, aftercare. Gives the `student_id` other tools need. |
| `schoolpass_get_profile(view?)` | The parent account profile. |
| `schoolpass_list_drivers(view?)` | Authorized pickup drivers, with their carpools. |
| `schoolpass_get_calendar(student_id, start_date?, end_date?, view?)` | A student's arrival/dismissal calendar over a range (defaults today → 14 days out). |
| `schoolpass_list_pickup_changes(student_id, date?, view?)` | Pickup/dismissal changes for a student on a date (defaults today). |
| `schoolpass_list_dismissal_locations(view?)` | The school's dismissal locations (car line, bus, aftercare, walkers…) with ids. |
| `schoolpass_get_school_info(view?)` | Basic school info and per-school config. |
| `schoolpass_submit_dismissal_change(student_id, date, change_type, …, confirm)` | Submit a dismissal/arrival change (absent, early dismissal, late arrival, move to carpool/bus/location). CONFIRM-GATED: without confirm:true returns a dry-run preview and makes no change; with confirm:true submits and re-reads the calendar to prove it landed. |
| `schoolpass_cancel_dismissal_change(student_id, date, confirm)` | Cancel a change for a date, returning it to default. CONFIRM-GATED with a preview. |

## Response shape (`view`)

Seven read tools take `view: "compact" | "full"` — `schoolpass_list_students`,
`schoolpass_get_profile`, `schoolpass_list_drivers`,
`schoolpass_get_calendar`, `schoolpass_list_pickup_changes`,
`schoolpass_list_dismissal_locations` and `schoolpass_get_school_info` — and
**`compact` is the default**. The slim rung arrives without being asked for,
because an efficiency a caller has to know about and request is one that
usually is not requested.

**Compact strips image and avatar URLs, and claims no field projection.** What
actually goes on these tools is the student and driver photo URLs SchoolPass
hangs off each record — bytes a model cannot see or fetch. Everything else
arrives exactly as `full` would give it: this server hands SchoolPass's
payloads back close to verbatim and holds no captured fixture or documented
field list for them, so a named field set would be invented, and an invented
one returns a record with holes in it that still reads like a verified answer.

`view: "full"` returns the record untouched, photos included. There is **no
`raw` rung**: `full` already IS the untouched payload, so a third value could
only alias it.

`view` is this server's vocabulary and never reaches SchoolPass — a test pins
that, because two sibling repos leaked it into the upstream query by spreading
the whole argument object into the request.

The other four tools take no `view`:

- **`schoolpass_whoami`** answers with seven fields this server assembles by
  name — member id, user type and its label, first and last name, email, school
  code. There is no un-projected payload left underneath for a media rule to
  act on, so a `view` here would be a parameter that decides nothing, which is
  worse than none.
- **`schoolpass_submit_dismissal_change` and
  `schoolpass_cancel_dismissal_change`** are writes. A write's response is a
  receipt — a preview, or a status plus the calendar re-read that proves the
  change landed — with nothing to strip and everything to keep.
- **`schoolpass_healthcheck`** answers reachability and auth, separately, and
  carries no record at all.

A test in `tests/tools.test.ts` asserts this exact roster: if a read tool gains
`view` and is not added to the covered cases, it fails. That guard exists
because a sibling repo shipped fourteen tools whose `view` was never wired up,
and the suite stayed green.

## Notes

- **Parent scope only.** A parent token cannot reach admin routes (visitor
  management, carline operations, reports, bus routing); those return `403` with
  a hint saying so.
- **Writes are confirm-gated.** `schoolpass_submit_dismissal_change` and
  `schoolpass_cancel_dismissal_change` change a child's real dismissal. Without
  `confirm: true` they make no network call and return a preview — always show
  the user the preview and get explicit confirmation before sending.
  `change_type` is one of absent / late_arrival / early_dismissal / carpool /
  activity / bus / virtual; `move_to_id` is a dismissal-location id
  (schoolpass_list_dismissal_locations) or a carpool id (from the calendar).
- **Never echo the password or a session token** into the conversation.
